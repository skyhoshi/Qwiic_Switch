This file defines the memoryMap struct, which acts as the pseudo register map
of the Qwiic Button/Switch. It also serves as an easy way to access variables
and manipulate the state of the device.

During I2C transactions, the memoryMap object is wrapped as a collection of
bytes. The byte that the user is interested in (either to read or write) is
selected with a register pointer. For instance, if the user sets the pointer
to 0x0e, they will be addressing the 4th uint8_t sized object in this struct.
In this case, that would be the interruptConfig register!

This code is beerware; if you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
